# 🎨 AI Content Studio (Brief 3)

An innovative, agentic workspace for creating high-performance social media content. Built for the **Figmenta Internship Assignment**.

Instead of a generic clone, I built a specialized **"Vogue-Grade" Editorial Tool** that uses AI to not just write content, but design it.
